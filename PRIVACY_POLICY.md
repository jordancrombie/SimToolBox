# MWSIM Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** December 16, 2025

## Overview

MWSIM ("Mobile Wallet Simulator") is part of the SimToolBox ecosystem—a **sandbox environment for educational and demonstration purposes only**. This is not a real financial application. No real money, real bank accounts, or real payment processing is involved.

## The Golden Rule: Don't Use Real Information

**This is a simulation. Please treat it like one.**

- **Do NOT use your real email address** — Make one up (e.g., `testuser123@fake.com`)
- **Do NOT use real passwords** you use elsewhere
- **Do NOT enter real financial information**
- **Do NOT use your real name** if you're uncomfortable with it being exposed

We do not validate email addresses. You can use any string that looks like an email. We recommend using obviously fake addresses to protect yourself.

## What We Collect

When you use MWSIM, the following data is stored on our servers:

| Data | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| Email address (fake recommended) | Account identification |
| Name (fake recommended) | Display purposes |
| Device identifier | Session management |
| Simulated card data | Wallet functionality |
| Simulated transaction history | Demo payment flows |

## How We Use Your Data

Your data is used solely to:
- Provide the wallet simulation functionality
- Demonstrate payment flows between SimToolBox components
- Enable the educational features of the platform

We do **NOT**:
- Sell your data to third parties
- Use your data for marketing
- Share your data outside the SimToolBox ecosystem
- Process any real financial transactions

## Security Disclaimer

**IMPORTANT: This is a sandbox environment with sandbox-level security.**

While we implement reasonable security practices, this platform is designed for learning and demonstration—not for protecting sensitive personal information.

**By using MWSIM and the BankSim.ca ecosystem, you acknowledge that:**

1. This is an educational sandbox, not a production financial system
2. You should not enter any real personal, financial, or sensitive information
3. We cannot guarantee the security of data stored in this system
4. We are not liable for any exposure of information you choose to enter
5. If the system is compromised, any data you entered may be exposed

**If you ignore our warnings and use real personal information anyway, you do so entirely at your own risk.**

## Data Retention

- Account data persists until you delete your account or we reset the sandbox
- We may periodically clear all sandbox data without notice
- There is no guarantee of data persistence—this is a demo environment

## Children's Privacy

MWSIM is intended for developers, students, and professionals learning about fintech. We do not knowingly collect information from children under 13.

## Your Rights

You can:
- Delete your account and associated data through the app
- Request data deletion by contacting us
- Stop using the service at any time

## Third-Party Services

MWSIM connects to other SimToolBox services:
- **BSIM** (banksim.ca) — Banking simulator
- **WSIM** (wsim.banksim.ca) — Web wallet simulator
- **SSIM** (ssim.banksim.ca) — Store simulator

The same privacy principles apply across all SimToolBox services.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this policy at any time. Continued use of MWSIM constitutes acceptance of any changes.
